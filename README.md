# RESTful API Demo

This project is a partial implementation of a Leprechaun social network. It is purely designed as jumping off point for discussions on a few opinionated best practices in API design and a practice application of those practices.

* Version your API
* Always use SSL (Leprechauns are very secretive)
* Auth tokens can offload some server load
* Use HTTP methods appropriately
* Keep your resource URLs simple
  * Make relationships nested segments
  * Move advanced* use cases into query strings
  * Add shortcut routes for common queries
* Be declarative in defining model properties, ACL, validations and relationships
* Document your API
* Use cache headers for clients
* Use server cache
* Provide consumable error responses
* Write tests for failures & successes

_*embedding, sorting, filtering, field limiting, pagination_

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/MikeCostello/api-demo.git
cd api-demo
npm install
```

To launch the API server run:  
```npm start```

Documentation is a good place to start [https://localhost:3000/explorer](https://localhost:3000/explorer) and is generated by [swagger](http://swagger.io)


### SSL Caveat
The HTTPS server uses a self signed certificate. While CA and domain mismatch warnings can safely be ignored, installing the cert locally will clear them up.
[Installing Self-signed Certificates](http://www.robpeck.com/2010/10/google-chrome-mac-os-x-and-self-signed-ssl-certificates/#.VugiGhIrLqY)

### Testing

The generated documentation itself can be used directly to explore the API, alternatively a [collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeCostello/api-demo/master/api-demo.json.postman_collection) of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) calls can be imported. The **first call should always** be to ```Clients/login``` to retrieve an auth token.

To run unit tests:  
```npm test```
